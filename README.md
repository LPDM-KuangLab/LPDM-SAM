## Introduction of the model  <a name="introduction"></a>

This Lagrangian parcel dispersion model (LPDM) is a Fortran module that can be embedded in a Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) models or Cloud-Resolving Models (CRMs). The LPDM can release Lagrangian particles in the LES/CRMs, track their locations, and output their trajectories. This model has been widely used in a variety of topics in atmospheric convection (see [LPDM related publications](#publication)).

## Model description and validation  <a name="description-validation"></a>

We are still working on this section.

## Implementing the source code <a name="implementing-src"></a>

An example version of SAM source code with LPDM can be found at /LPDM_tutorial/src/SRC_LPDM_example. This SRC_LPDM_example is based on SAM 6.10.6. It is very likely that users want to use a different version of SAM source code. Therefore, we documented here how to implement LPDM model into your customized SAM code.

#### 1. Add lpdm_mod.f90
copy lpdm_mod.f90 (src/SRC_LPDM_example/lpdm_mod.f90) into your SRC directory.

#### 2. Modify grid.f90

add the following codes into grid.f90 (see src/SRC_LPDM_example/grid.f90 line 254-258)

``` fortran
! parameters for lpdm
logical:: lpdm_do =.false.       ! run LPDM jinie
integer:: lpdm_ndt =5      ! lpdm output time interval (dt)
integer:: lpdm_sub =1     ! seperate output on subdomain on x
integer:: lpdm_start =0    ! time step when to start the LPDM
```

#### 3. Modify main.f90

add the following line (src/SRC_LPDM_example/main.f90 line 11)

``` fortran
use lpdm_mod
```

add the following two lines (src/SRC_LPDM_example/main.f90 line 80-81) after call setforcing()

``` fortran
if(lpdm_do)  call lpdm_ini
if(lpdm_do)  call lpdm_output
```

add the following lines (src/SRC_LPDM_example/main.f90 line 350-357) after call stepout(nstatsteps)

``` fortran
! before running lpdm, update the boundaries informations

 if (lpdm_do .and. nstep.ge.lpdm_start) then
   call boundaries(0)
   call boundaries(2)
   call lpdm_update
   call lpdm_output
 endif

```

#### 4. Modify printout.f90

add the following line (src/SRC_LPDM_example/printout.f90 line 6)

``` fortran
use lpdm_mod, only: lpdm_top,lpdm_num
```

add the following lines (src/SRC_LPDM_example/printout.f90 line 253-260)

``` fortran
print*,'run LPDM = ', lpdm_do
if (lpdm_do) then
print*,'lpdm_top = ',lpdm_top
print*,'lpdm_num = ',lpdm_num
print*,'lpdm_ndt = ',lpdm_ndt
print*,'lpdm_sub = ',lpdm_sub
print*,'lpdm_start = ', lpdm_start
endif
```

#### 5. Modify setparm.f90

add the following line (src/SRC_LPDM_example/setparm.f90 line 49) to add the following variables into the "NAMELIST /PARAMETERS/".

``` fortran
lpdm_do, lpdm_ndt, lpdm_sub, lpdm_start ! for LPDM
```

## How to run LPDM  <a name="run-lpdm"></a>

A full description of how to run SAM is documented in [Harvard Climate Modeling](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/climatemodeling/SAM), including how to setup turn on LPDM and properly set LPDM related parameters. The following content here are basically copied from [Harvard Climate Modeling](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/climatemodeling/SAM):

#### During compiling
During compiling the model (before building the model), to set the Lagrangian particle dispersion model, go to SRC/lpdm_mod.f90 and set lpdm_top and lpdm_num. Each Lagrangian particle represents an air parcel with a given mass of m (m depends on lpdm_top and lpdm_num and is the same for all the Lagrangian particles).
``` fortran
integer, parameter :: lpdm_top  = 70  ! top level below which particles are initially released, mirror reflection b.c.
integer, parameter :: lpdm_num   = 700  ! the number of particles initially in one column
```

To support lpdm, nx_gl and ny_gl has the upper limit of 999, and  nsubdomain_x *nsubdomain_y has the upper limit of 214 (or edit source code)

#### Before submitting a job
To run lpdm model, you need to specify parameters in the prm file under your specific case directory

```
lpdm_do =  .true ,  ! true or false, set it to be true if you want to include particle model
lpdm_ndt = 4,   ! frequency to output particle location
lpdm_sub=64,  ! total number of processors used, should be consistent with the total number of cores specified
```


For the current LPDM model, it does not have the restart function, I will add this function in the future. Therefore if your run stops
before it finishes, you will need to start from the beginning. REMEMBER: Remove the existing lpdm output first!!


## Post-processing LPDM output  <a name="post-processing"></a>

LPDM outputs are stored in [SAM output directory]/OUT_LPDM

Here we provide an example script (utils/lpdm_loadxyz.m) which can convert the .xyz output into .mat files. Please follow the comments in lpdm_loadxyz.m to adjust paths and parameters properly to your own case.
